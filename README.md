Hey there,

A long time computer/tech hobbyist and enjoyer, studying and getting certifications to pursue a new career in Information Technology.  

Besides computers and tech, I also enjoy team sports, scuba diving, snowboarding, cooking, hiking, fishing, kayaking, and all sorts of cool outdoor activities. I love the ocean and water too :ocean:

I have loads of experience in home networking, IP address traffic and protocol analyzers, firewalls, and troubleshooting various home computing devices and operating systems. 

Currently holding CompTIA A+ and getting N+ & S+ before end of the year! 

Thanks for stopping by :sunglasses:
