Hey there,

Update: currently working full-time as an 'IT Technician' for Highland Park Board of Education, NJ. 

A long time computer/tech hobbyist and enjoyer. I'm currently studying, getting a few certifications and homelabbing to start my career in Information Technology. I also worked in tech sales (B2B) for a few years.  

Currently holding CompTIA A+

Thanks for stopping by :sunglasses:
