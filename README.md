Hey there,

A long time computer/tech hobbyist and enjoyer. I'm currently studying, getting a few certifications and homelabbing to start my career in Information Technology. I also worked in tech sales (B2B) for a few years.  

Besides computers and some occasional PC gaming, I also enjoy sports, scuba diving, snowboarding, cooking, hiking, fishing, kayaking, and all sorts of cool outdoor activities. I love the ocean and water too :ocean:

I have loads of experience in home networking, IP address traffic and protocol analyzers, firewalls, and troubleshooting various home computing devices and operating systems. 

Currently holding CompTIA A+ and getting N+ & S+ before end of the year! 

Thanks for stopping by :sunglasses:
